# Pokemoon ERC-404 v2.0

[Pokemoon.space](https://pokemoon.space/) is implemented based on the new experimental ERC404 v2.0 standard developed by [Pandora Labs](https://github.com/Pandora-Labs-Org/erc404).
When purchasing an ERC20 Pokemoon token, the user will receive a free ERC721 token with a randomly dropped Pokemon.

As you know, there are Pokemon that evolve and don't evolve. The peculiarity of Pokemoon.space is that if the user gets a Pokemon that is evolving, then depending on the time of holding the ERC20 and, accordingly, ERC721 token, the metadata with the image and description of the Pokemon will be automatically replaced with others corresponding to the next stage of evolution of a particular Pokemon. It follows that by holding the ERC721 token, the user can wait for the moment when his ERC721 token receives the image of a Pokemon that does not drop out when purchasing an ERC20 Pokemon token.
